This project contains two python files:

Client.py: Captures video from the laptop's webcam, converts it to a bit string, and sends it over to the server.

Server.py: Receives video data from the client, converts it from bytes to video frames, and
displays them.

How to run the program:
1. Run server.py
2. Run client.py

How to stop the program:
Go over to the python window that's showing the video, and press 'q'.
